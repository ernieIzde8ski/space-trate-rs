# space-trate-rs

a library for the [space traders](https://docs.spacetraders.io) game

## how do i build it

do it like any other rust lib

## what if i want to help develop it

you need rustfmt-nightly to format it. `rustup toolchain install nightly --allow-downgrade -c rustfmt` to install, followed by `rustup run nightly cargo fmt`, happens to work well enough for me. i store as a Shell Alias
